To check disk;
du -sh
gdisk -l /dev/sda

Edit /etc/sudoers to allow users to run with root priviledges

echo >> filename--> use to append data
echo > filename-->overwrite data


cd /folderName/; pwd
; --> used for compiling command and execute both commands.


ls -lh output
d is folder
- is  file
- rwx(for user) -rwx(for group) -r(for anyone in the system) --

if - that means the permission is not set

changing Permissions
chmod u-w(write) or u-x(execute) or u-r(read) /FolderName to remove write permission!

chmod u+wrx /FolderName--> To give permisssions.


Ownerships;
ls -ld * list all 

chmod u =rwx,g=rx,o=r /FolderName
chown root(User):root(Group) /FolderName

Octal Permissions;
r is (4) w is (2) x is (1) 0 for no permissions

SoftLinks;
ln -s /FolderName LinkName
file LinkName

ln -s /FolderName LinkName

cd LinkName 

pwd -P
remove symbolic links and show all content.

Hardlinks-cannot be created for directories,
Deleting a target file for a symbolic link makes that link useless, In hardlinks-- Any changes to the data on the inode is reflected in all files that refer to that inode.

A Soft Link
can cross the file system,
allows you to link between directories,
has different inodes number and file permissions than original file,
permissions will not be updated,
has only the path of the original file, not the contents.
A hard Link

can’t cross the file system boundaries,
can’t link directories,
has the same inodes number and permissions of original file,
permissions will be updated if we change the permissions of source file,
has the actual contents of original file, so that you still can view the contents, even if the original file moved or removed.


ls -i to check inodes number



Pipes "|";
ps -e To list process
ps -e | awk '{print $4}' | sort -f | cat -n >  FileName


'{print $4}'--> Print the 4th column in ps -e command.

To read a long document use "less -N /FileName"

To search use forward /

? To search backward

head print first 10 liness
head -20n /Filename

tail last 10 lines
tail -n4 /FileName | cat -9--> Last 4 lines

tail -f /FileName
List recent enteries


tail -f /var/log/audit/audit.log-Security log file
run something and check in logs for;

grep 1000 /etc/passwd

grep -i user_auth /var/log/audit/audit/log | grep res=failed |  wc -l
